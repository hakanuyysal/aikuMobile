It can instantly generate and update floor plans, annotate CAD/BIM models, and extract dimensions and material specifications from PDFs, scans, and point clouds—eliminating manual data entry and reducing errors. By embedding generative and parametric design engines directly into tools like Revit, AutoCAD, Rhino/Grasshopper, SAP2000, and ETABS, Howie lets you explore dozens of schematic alternatives based on constraints such as daylight targets, structural spans, and adjacency requirements, then applies evolutionary and gradient‐based optimization to refine layouts for energy performance, material efficiency, or cost goals.\n\nSeamlessly integrating with your existing workflow, Howie syncs live project views across teams, maintains version control and change logs, and supports real‐time collaboration through cloud‐based sharing and annotation. Intelligent templates adapt to local building codes, climate data, and material libraries, while on‐demand simulations deliver instant feedback on structural integrity, thermal comfort, and daylighting metrics. Predictive analytics monitor schedules and budgets, flagging deviations early and suggesting corrective actions, and automated documentation tools draft specification reports and client presentations. With end‐to‐end encryption, granular access controls, and an open API for custom extensions, Howie scales to meet the evolving needs of any practice, empowering professionals to focus on creativity and strategic decision-making.",

  "detailedDescription": "The company combines medical-grade computed tomography (CT) hardware with proprietary machine-learning software to non-invasively scan complete electric-vehicle (EV) battery packs and pinpoint internal defects—micro-cracks, structural fissures, and dendritic growth—without ever opening the casing. By feeding high-resolution 3D CT images through deep-learning models trained on thousands of pack inspections, the platform automatically detects and classifies anomalies in minutes that would otherwise take days to uncover, giving manufacturers and service providers rapid, data-driven insights into cell integrity and safety.\n\nBuilt around modular, portable imaging units and cloud-connected analytics, the solution seamlessly integrates into both automotive service lines and stationary energy-storage systems (ESS). Its plug-and-play scanners can be deployed at vehicle maintenance facilities or ESS sites, while the ML engine continually refines detection algorithms based on new inspection data. The result is extended pack lifetimes, optimized performance, reduced downtime, and a clear path to second-life reuse—helping OEMs, fleet operators, and energy providers maximize value and safety across the full EV battery lifecycle.",
